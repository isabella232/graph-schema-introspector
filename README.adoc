This is a Proof of concept (PoC) for a Neo4j schema introspector that produces output in JSON format validating against https://github.com/neo4j/graph-schema-json-js-utils[graph-schema-json-js-utils]. It is packaged as a Neo4j user-defined procedure under the name `experimental.introspect.asJson({})`.

== Compiling and running

You need Java 17 for this project to compile and package. It is build against Neo4j 5 and thus requires Neo4j 5 to run.

Assuming Neo4j is installed in a `NEO4J_HOME`, please execute the following steps

.Stop your Neo4j instance (optional)
[source,bash]
----
$NEO4J_HOME/bin/neo4j stop
----

.Package this project
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw -Dfast clean package
----

.Copy the resulting artifact into your Neo4j installation and start the latter
[source,bash]
----
cp -v target/graph-schema-introspector-*.jar $NEO4J_HOME/plugins
$NEO4J_HOME/bin/neo4j start
----

After a bit, the instance will have started. For the sake of a functional readme, we assume a database password `verysecret`.

You call the procedure like this:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL experimental.introspect.asJson({prettyPrint: true})
----

This will return a single column named `value` containing the schema of the database as valid JSON for further processing.

The following command will use Cypher-Shell to pipe the JSON (with some post-processing) through `jq` and eventually to standard out:

[source,bash]
----
$NEO4J_HOME/bin/cypher-shell -uneo4j -pverysecret --format plain  --non-interactive 'CALL experimental.introspect.asJson({}) YIELD value RETURN value AS _json_' |  sed -e 's/\\"/"/g' -e 's/^"//g' -e 's/"$//g' -e 's/_json_//g'| jq
----

NOTE: In the script above, https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[`jq`] is used to format the JSON. While the UDF can pretty print, Cypher-Shell always quotes quotes (turning `"` into `\"`), thus making the output useless. Therefor it is processed first with `sed` and then piped through `jq`.

A visualization of that schema can be generated with the following statement:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL experimental.introspect.asGraph({})
----

It will visualize the schema document, not the graph itself. The result for the Movie example graph will look like this (you may have to configure the corresponding properties to be used as display names):

== Options

The following options can be passed as arguments:

|===
|Name |Type |Meaning |Default

|`prettyPrint`
|Boolean
|Pretty prints the generated JSON
|`false`

|`useConstantIds`
|Boolean
|Uses constant ids for the tokens, derived from their names. Setting this to false generates unique ids
|`true`

|`quoteTokens`
|Boolean
|Tokens that would need quotation and sanitization when used in Cypher statements will be treated as such by default
|`true`
